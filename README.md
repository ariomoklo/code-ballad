# CodeBallad

This is a fun remake project for my university final project.

## About my first version of CodeBallad

That time I tried to built everything from scratch and that was a mistake. A cluncky PHP Homemade framework with phaser. But it works fine.

CodeBallad was a game that help you lear code, or that was how it should be. The idea was a battle bot kinda game, so the player made an algorithm using a fine tuned keyword subset of javascript like punch or kick additional action function.

Target for the project is conducting research on how gamification can affect learning programming.

## My plan for the remake

The wolfensvelte project on sveltehack was awesome. snuffyDev was makin a 3D game only using a html element with no canvas or webgl.
That as inspiration my stack is decided to sveltekit. I found that svelte tween and animation would be enough to do the game effect.

## Game Play

So there is a board with minimal of 3x3. Like the old one, there is a player character and enemy. Player will create a sequence of order for the character to defeat all the enemy. A sequence can be grouped as a function, and player can code many function. Function can be run many times too and can be used in next battle or level. Enemy will have his own function or algorithm.
